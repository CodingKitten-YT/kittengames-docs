# Run Locally

To run your game locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodingKitten-YT/kittengames.git
```

This command clones the repository to your local machine.

2. Install http-server globally by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
npm install --global http-server
```

This command installs http-server, which is a simple, zero-configuration command-line HTTP server for serving static files.

3. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository using the cd command:
   (for example)

```bash
cd kittengames
```

4. Start the HTTP server by running the following command:

```bash
http-server
```

5. Open your web browser and go to localhost:8080 to view your game website.
