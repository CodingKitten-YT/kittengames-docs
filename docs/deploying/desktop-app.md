## Desktop App

I'm currently working on developing a desktop application for the game website using Electron.js.

[Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) is a framework that allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Stay tuned for updates on the progress of the desktop app development!
