When you download the EXE file and run it, it will install the application onto your system.

### Updating to New Versions
When a new version of the app is available, simply download and run the new installer to update your installation.

### Note on Security
Please note that since the installer is not signed with a digital certificate, it may be flagged as a potential virus by some antivirus software. This is due to the lack of a code signing certificate, which requires a significant fee. However, you can safely proceed with the installation as the app is not harmful.
