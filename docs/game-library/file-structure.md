## File Structure

When organizing your game list on GitHub, it's best to follow a structured approach to maintain clarity and accessibility. Here's a suggested file structure:

1. **games.json**: This JSON file serves as the central repository for your game list. It contains all the necessary information about each game, such as name, image URL, and game URL. Naming it `games.json` makes it easy for developers and users to identify and access.

2. **images/**: Create a folder named `images/` to store all the images associated with your games. Each game entry in the `games.json` file references an image URL. By storing these images in a separate folder, you keep your project organized and make it simple to manage and update images as needed.

### Example File Structure:

```
Your repository
├─ images
│ └─ image.png
└─ games.json
```

By organizing your game list in this manner, you create a clear and structured repository on GitHub, making it easier for contributors to understand and contribute to your project. Additionally, it enhances the overall user experience by ensuring smooth access to game information and images.
